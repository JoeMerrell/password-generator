This is the UCLA Coding Bootcamp's assignment for the third module (Javascript).

According to the description of the assignment:

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

I've added comments to the script.js file that help clarify (for me mostly) what different parts of the code are doing. While I struggled a great deal with this assignment (my tutor is AWOL btw), I think I accomplished most of what was expected apart from a couple of points (validation of input primarily). Will attempt to revise along with previous assignments.
